<h1>Genshin Impact Farming Helper</h1>

This web application fetches data from the genshin.dev API, and sets up dynamic character cards that give a bit of information about the individual characters.
Additionally, the site will save your character level if you change it, and help you calculate what materials you need to gather to further develop your team.
Images and colors for the character cards are dynamically set when you choose a character, according to their name and 'vision' or elemental affinity.

When you adjust the ascension level using the dropdown next to the character names, it dynamically generates input boxes so that you can keep track of what materials that you need! The input boxes are capped at the amount of materials required for the specified ascension level, while the names and numbers of materials change dynamically as you change characters so you always can quickly find what you need!
